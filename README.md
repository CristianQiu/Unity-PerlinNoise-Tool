# About
This Unity project contains a tool for 2D Perlin Noise texture generation, with FBM support. 
The noise generation is jobified, burst compiled and written to the texture without intermediate buffers, so it is fast even for high resolution textures.

To show the window go to Window -> Tools -> Perlin noise texture generator.
